# bikesharing

## Overview

This project uses Tableau to examine data regarding how a bike sharing business operates in New York City. This analysis will then be used to inform a proposal to create a bike sharing business in Des Moines, IA.

## Results

Several visualizations were created to represent the NYC Bikesharing Data. First, a line graph was created to represent the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. As is evident in the line graph, bikes are rarely used for more than 40 minutes. Most trips are under 30 minutes in length with the most frequent time peaking around 10 or 15 minutes.

This analysis was further aggregated by gender as is represented in the next line graph. This visualization reveals that males check out the bikes for longer periods of time as well as more frequently. 




A heatmap was created to graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day. The darker colors indicate heavier usage appears during common commuting times, e.g., 8:00 a.m. and 5 â€“ 6 p.m. during the week. On the weekends the bike usage is mostly consistent throughout the day.





The heatmap analysis was further aggregated by gender. This visualization reinforces the previous visualization that heavier usage occurs among males during common commute times. The usage by females is must more consistent throughout the each day and week. 





Another heatmap analysis was conducted by looking at the number of bike trips broke down by gender for each day of the week and then aggregated by customer type.  This visualization reinforces that the males dominate the usage during the week but also further reveals that these male customers are in fact subscribers to the bikesharing program.



Next, a map was created to display the bike stations where trips originate. The more popular stations are indicated by the size of the circle and the darkness of the blue color. This map reveals that there seems to be a certain part of NYC that is favored for beginning bike trips. 


Lastly, the number of short-term customers and annual subscribers were examined to determine the types of customers we could expect. This data is represented in a pie chart. The proportion of customers to annual subscribers is approximately 1 to 4. 



## Summary

This data provides insight into usage of bikes in a very large, densely populated city.  In general, the data revealed that the bikes are heavily used by male subscribers during common commute times. Female customer usage tends to be more consistent throughout both the weekdays and weekends. Most users checkout the bikes for 30 minutes or less.

Further analyses will be needed to see if this bikesharing program could be a good fit in Des Moines, IA. One analysis could include examining the square footage of available parking areas in relation to ending locations of bike trips. The availability of parking in relation to bike rental stations could impact the utilization of the bikesharing program. Additionally, an analysis of bike usage to compare recreational use versus transportation to employment could further inform subscriber to customer proportions and relative marketing strategies to promote the program.
